### Hi there 👋

I'm Luke. I mainly enhance web applications.  
The experiences in my life has helped me to build a much neater and detailed software.  
Currently, I work as a web front-end developer due to my interest in modern web technologies.  
I’m interested in communications, exercising, global news and economics. I’m also interested in learning and creating.  
My motto is 유심소현(唯心所現) and A little interest can make changes.  
Any suggestions or improvements are welcome!
